# EasyEffects-Presets
**Presets for [EasyEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects) on [Pipewire](https://pipewire.org/) (Bose, Custom Bass and Sony).**

## Installation
### Download of presets
* Click on `Code` in this repository.
* Then select `Download ZIP`.

### Import of presets
* You can use the `Import Preset` button that is beside the `Add` preset button.

Or
* Move the **JSON** presets to `~/.config/easyeffects/output`.
* If you have installed EasyEffects with Flatpak, it's here `~/.var/app/com.github.wwmm.easyeffects/config/easyeffects/output`.

## Presets dependencies
You will need to install the `calf-plugins` or `calf`, `lsp-plugins` or `lsp-plugins-lv2` and `zam-plugins` or `zam-plugins-lv2` packages from your GNU/Linux distribution to enable the presets effects.

## Bass settings
Adjust your bass to the speaker levels if the presets are not suitable or use EasyEffects in `Plugins`, select a preset and then change `Quantity` in dB of `Bass Enhancer` (be careful of saturation 😉️).

Saves the changes in `Presets`.

# 🖤️ Enjoy the sound 🖤️
