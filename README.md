# EasyEffects-Presets
Presets for EasyEffects on Pipewire (Bass Boost, Bose and Sony).

## Installation
### Download presets
* Click on `Code` in this repository.
* Then select `Download ZIP`.

### Importation
* You can use the `Import Preset` button that is beside the `Add` preset button.

Or
* Copy the JSON presets to `~/.config/easyeffects/output`.
* If you have installed Pipewire with Flatpak, it's here `~/.var/app/com.github.wwmm.easyeffects/config/easyeffects/output`.

## Presets dependencies
You will need to install the `calf` and `lsp-plugins` packages from your GNU/Linux distribution to enable the preset effects.

## Settings
Adjust your bass to the speaker levels if the presets are not suitable or with EasyEffects in `Effects`, then change `Quantity` in dB of `Bass Enhancer` (be careful of saturation :) ).

Saves the changes in `Preset`.
